#
# Problem:
# Your friend has sent a text file with lines containing a secret message.
# You're supposed to find the meeting time and place using the following hints:
#
# 1. The number of lines in the file tells you the meeting time.
#    - If the number of lines < 12, it's that many AM.
#    - If it's between 12 and 24, convert to 12-hour format and display AM/PM.
#
# 2. The word that appears most frequently gives the meeting place.
#    - Example: if "Park" appears most â†’ Meeting place is "Park Street"
#
# Sample Output:
# Meeting time: 3 PM
# Meeting place: Apollo Street
